Automatic, symbolic simplification of sums. Simplifies symbolic constants of the form Sum[a_i x_i], where a_i are rational, x_i complex. These are symbolic expressions that can be evaluated to arbitrary numerical precision. 


Building:           Evaluate all cells in "SimplifySum.nb"

Use:                Run simplifySum[x] to simplify a constant. 
                    See paper and examples for advanced usage. 

Examples:           Open "Examples.nb"

Examples of rules:  Open "RuleList.nb"
